Triggers (and follows) a build in the `BuildConfig` related to the repository
being built.

The resulting image is tagged with `context.shortGitCommit`.

If the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists, the templates in there will be applied using https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor]. In addition to the configuration options below, one can use e.g. a `Tailorfile` to adjust the behaviour of Tailor as needed.
